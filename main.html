	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by technology and its potential to improve lives. As I grew older, I realized that software development is not just about writing code; it's about solving problems, creating solutions, and making a positive impact on the world. The ability to create something from nothing, to turn ideas into reality, is what drives me to pursue a career in software development. I am passionate about learning new technologies, collaborating with others, and constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Becoming a software developer is not just a career choice for me; it's a calling, a way to contribute to something greater than myself and leave a lasting legacy.</p>
